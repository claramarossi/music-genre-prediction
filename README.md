# Course
"Computational statistics" - third year of bachelor. Its goal is to illustrate some computational statistical tools which are fundamental for data analysis and modeling, such as mixture models, model-based clustering and classification. 

# Project
The objective of our analysis is twofold. First, we aim to identify clusters of songs with similar characteristics using an unsupervised approach. Since we already have the actual classifications, we can evaluate the accuracy of the clustering by comparing it to the true categorization. Second, we seek to train a classifier capable of predicting the correct cluster for new songs based on their features. This supervised approach will allow us to automate the classification process and assess the modelâ€™s ability to recognize patterns in musical data. By combining both methods, we gain insights into the underlying structure of the dataset while also developing a predictive model that can generalize to unseen data.
